Yet this state of affairs did not last long, for the Revolución Libertadora saw him freed and promoted to Rear Admiral. \n\n Frondizi's failure to purge the influence of the Partido Justicialista made him the first to plot his overthrowing. \n\n Now that Frondizi has fallen, his efforts have seen him reach a position of great influence in the Régimen de Reconstrucción Nacional."

 Juan_Carlos_Lorio_sec_desc:0 "General Lorio is an Infantry officer with a rather irregular service. \n\nHe did not hold many commands during his career, being a professor in the Escuela Superior de Guerra during the Tyrant's regime. When he fell, he proved reticent to execute those members of the Army who rebelled against the Revolución LIbertadora, which did not help his military career. \n\n His return to service as Commander of the Army happened due to his relation with General Poggi. Many things can be said about the new President of Argentina: But that he does not understand the need to have powerful friends around him is not one of them."

 POLITICS_AF_DESC:0 "The Golden Boy of the OFN. That’s the nickname that the American political establishment uses to call the President of the Republic of Argentina. A close friend of Vice-President John F. Kennedy, Arturo Frondizi made a name for himself both inside and outside the country. After obtaining his law degree, he started a passionate political career influenced by the death of Radical leader Hipolito Yrigoyen. From then, he would become a rising star inside the UCR. A committed antifascist, Frondizi advocated for approaching the OFN to protect the country from the aggressive tide of fascism. To his dismay, the people embraced the charismatic Italian-backed leader Juan Perón and it would take a military coup to put his own ideas into practice. \n\n Using his political connections in Washington, Frondizi aims to promote his Developmentalist policies to end Argentinian dependence on exportations and transform the country into an industrial powerhouse. He also advocates for a policy of gradual reconciliation with the defeated Peronists, allowing their reintroduction to political life with conditions. But the Argentinian people reject his policies. It doesn’t matter how many countries he visits or how many commercial agreements he signs: workers still refuse to work and students still protest on the streets. With the wound of the Malvinas open, Frondizi struggles to establish a long-term relationship with the OFN. As the threat of economic catastrophe grows and the fascist menace lurks in the shadows, a question haunts the President: how to protect the people from themselves?"
 POLITICS_PEA_DESC:0 "Pedro Eugenio Aramburu, truly a controversial figure in Argentine political history. Born in 1903 to a humble farmer family in a small cottage-turned village named Rio Cuarto, his natural aptitude for leadership and strong-arming would quickly point the young man towards the Military Academy. It wouldn’t take long for his charismatic self to insert itself into the inner machinations and complex mechanisms of the military, quickly rising through the ranks due to his appeasing yet staunch stance on his views, namely Anti-Peronism, many shared a similar hatred of the revolutionary zeal that the once-general deposited into the lowly masses, seen as not much more than a populist degenerate, Pedro exploited this relation to the maximum, with ample success. Already becoming a well-respected and known figure by 1954, as his general rank would denote, Aramburu had successfully webbed himself into the trappings of Argentine politics, no institution had as much interest in the hell that was the constantly developing Platense public affairs as the soldierly, that with all the tumultuous problems faced by the country ever since the rise in popularity of a certain general. And Aramburu knew this, he knew it very well, and his knowledge would culminate in the Magnus opus of his life’s work, the Revolucion Libertadora. \n\n A bleak September day of 1956, he remembered it clearly, a shot to the temple of the commanding officer in an artillery school, sublevations across the provinces, a blockade of the main national port of the navy. But the worst thing of all: the unbearable pain on his right leg when a treacherous enemy bullet reached him. Still, a sense of proudness overcame him that day, the day that the despicable fascists at the helm of the nation would be swayed away, and a new era of national revitalization would commence. But that wasn’t going to be the case. Admiral Rojas tried everything he could to eliminate the fascist cancer from the nation, but internal betrayal would be the downfall of his regime. It didn’t matter how strict the ban on Peronist nomenclature was or how many subversives were arrested: the Deposed Tyrant found a way to still attack the nation, even if he was far away in self-exile. This would, much to his distaste, result in the 1958 Constituent Assembly elections, bringing into power the ‘UCR’ candidate Frondizi, but Aramburu knew he was a crypto-Peronist, they were all crypto Peronists, nowhere was safe from the scourge that they brought. \n\n Now, thanks to his newly-formed UDELPA faction, Aramburu has managed to get a hold into power- and by democratic means no less. No matter how many fraudulent idiots like those in the academy or false democrats in the UCR he had to go through, he would save the nation, and the only way to do it is to eliminate the parasitic web of lies that have been holding the country back. The trade-unions will be crushed, the ineffective bureaucracy eliminated, and the intrusive state structure completely reformed for a new era. Nothing will remain from the failed fascist experiment."
 POLITICS_JCO_DESC:0 "Lieutenant General Juan Carlos Onganía is a very strange creature among the Argentinian high command: A man who is extremely capable at his job, and one who has reached his position without help nor opposition from the military or civilian power players.\n\nAlthough an extremely conservative and very religious man, he understands the need to cooperate with the more liberal sectors of society in order to rebuild Argentina and push it away from the more nefarious aspects of the Tyrant's ideology. It is well known that he has the sympathy of the Church, large sectors of the Armed Forces and even of the citizenry and business sectors. Even the more moderate members of the Tyrant's hosts speak with Onganía, although to what degree the General is willing to accept the return of the Tyrant is only he knows for sure.\n\nThe astute observer could say that the greatest threat Onganía will face in his mission to prevent the collapse of Argentina is overestimating is own extensive capabilities, and trying to bite more than he can chew. He would not be the first Argentinian to lose it all at the hands of his hubris, for that is the story of Argentina herself."
 POLITICS_RAP_DESC:0 "Being one of the oldest generals in the Argentinian High Command, Raúl Alejandro Poggi has seen it all and been part of very little. \n\n His lack of ideological alignment with the Tyrant during his regime saw him sidelined until it's fall, it was then his belonging to the Engineer Corps in a High Command controleld by the Cavalry Corps what left him outside the inner circle of power. Despite his relatively ordinary career, the General has his own political interests and aspirations. \n\n His arrival to the high spheres of power took place shortly before the start of the Frondizi presidency, with his promotion to Brigadier General. Since then, he has managed to use his conections to reach an unusual degree of power over the Argentinian Armed Forces and politics; Power that he aims to use to ensure the Tyrant's influence over Argentina is utterly purged and, maybe, even take him to Rivadavia's Chair along the way. \n\n Mayhap a man desperately opposed to fascism is exactly what Argentina needs to leave behind the darkest times in it's history, but rumors of his mental instability and chemical dependency have only increased, and his lack of pragmatism and ability to come to understandings may cost him his power and goals."
 POLITICS_JLR_DESC:0 "Many things could be said of Dr. José Luis Romero, a con-man, a dirty communist, a bleeding-heart progressive, but if he had to choose one thing that he was sure he wasn’t, it would be yet another fascist apologist. Having been a respected historian during his years tutoring the young students of the University of La Plata, that cozy spot of his would soon be thrown away due to his rather passionate views on what a certain Italian-inmigrant leader was doing with the direction of the country. His mouth would earn Mr. Romero a one-way trip to a self-exile in the neighboring nation of Uruguay, where he would remain all the way from 1945 to 1956, the year that ‘democracy’ finally returned to Argentina. \n\n As he stepped into the familiar bustle and muster of the capital port, he had to make a choice, either to continue his passive resistance to that wicked pseudo-populist ideology or take a more active approach. He was no stranger to the Partido Socialista, being a socialist himself and an active one at that, but he had never truly considered a career in politics. This all would change, however, as opportunities sprung up, deals here, some alleyway conversations there, many of his former students were important members in the party as well -- All of this netted him the chance to run as the Vice presidential candidate alongside Alfredo Palacios in the 1958 elections, against the blabbermouth of Balbin and the Peronist sympathizer of Frondizi. \n\n Of course, they didn’t get elected. And now, 4 years later, with the looming threat of the Tyrant on the horizon, the doubtful future of the Radicalist party, and the ever-watchful eye of the military, Romero will have to balance the odds into his favor, to even have a chance in maintaining this territory together."
 POLITICS_BALBIN_DESC:0 "Ricardo Balbin's life has been a crushingly depressing cycle of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.\n\nOnce a brilliant medicine student, he was forced to end his studies due to financial constraints. Only after working minor jobs for the Union Civica Radical was he able to return to university to become a lawyer. In the same year, he played a major role in the electoral campaign of Hipolito Yrigoyen, ensuring his appointment as district attorney of Mendoza, but he lost his job shortly afterwards when Yrigoyen was overthrown in a coup. In the subsequent elections, he was elected a national deputy, but never took office as the results were annulled. Ten years later, he was elected again but forced to resign alongside the rest of his party as a protest against the fraudulent presidential elections.\n\nAfter the election of Juan Peron in 1946, Balbin was arrested thrice for standing in opposition to the regime, and went through the increasingly humiliating cycle of being the UCR's official candidate in provincial and presidential elections the outcomes of which the Peronist party had already determined. With Peron's overthrow in 1956, Balbin, who for a decade had carried out the democratic resistance to his rule, saw his chance to enter the race as the undisputed candidate of the UCR. However, he was once more forced to stand for an election which he had no hope of winning by Arturo Frondizi's "secret" pact with Peron's supporters. Cheated out the nomination, Balbin resolved never to be betrayed again, and for the next six years, worked to ensure Frondizi would have to select him.\n\nAlthough it took a compromise on the choice of his economic policy, it now looks as if the Balbin curse has finally been lifted. Hardly able to believe it himself, Balbin relishes in his work finally being recognized by what he has always wanted: Being the democratically elected president."
 POLITICS_FRAMINI_DESC:0 "Andrés Framini was born mere days after the opening shots of the First World War. In 1930 he began working as a laborer for a textile company, and during the Revolución del 43 he too joined the cohors of the union movement.\nHe was present the 17th of October of 1945, and from that day onwards he'd remain loyal to Juan Domingo Perón, although largely beneath his notice for most of his presidency, until he took over his union in 1953.\n\nOnce Perón fled the country after the Revolución Libertadora, Framini became one of the primary figures of the Resistencia Peronista. Since then he worked tirelessly to organize the underground Peronist movement into a cohesive force capable of exerting it's influence and, hopefully, bring the movement back into power. The weakness of the Frondizi government, exacerbated in no small part by the efforts of Framini and other union bosses, and consequent failures in economy and policy both internal and external allowed resentment and despair to fester across the country. \nThis despair has had the desired effect. Many in Argentina believe that only the Peronistas can bring the nation back from the brink of the abyss, enough to grant Framini an electoral victory ample enough that the UCR and the Armed Forces have been forced to acknowledge it.\n\nNow the only question is whether Framini will live up to the expectations of the movement, and bring back Juan Domingo Perón. None can tell to what degree the old general will hold sway over the government, but many are torn between the fear that he will be the power behind the throne and the hope that Framini will be a more moderate figure who will not allow the barbarity and brutality of the past to be reenacted with the renewed fury of the vengeful."

 ARG_peronist_resistance_desc:0 "Даже после переворота 1956 года, в результате которого Перон был отстранен от власти, его сторонники никогда не прекращали борьбу за него. Бомбардировки, всеобщие забастовки, даже отказ рабочих выполнять свою работу и другие акты саботажа - обычное явление в Аргентине без Перона. Запрет Партии юстициалистов не останавливает десятки других партий, действующих от ее имени. Сначала президент Фрондизи занял более примирительную позицию в этом отношении, освободив политических заключенных и разрешив переговоры с профсоюзами. Однако вскоре стало ясно, что за подрывной деятельностью перонистов стояли иностранные державы. Находясь в изгнании в Италии, Перон координирует своих подчиненных, чтобы выполнять его приказы и дестабилизировать правительство гнусными методами. Но не только Италия заинтересована в ценном аргентинском экспорте: Германия и Япония также имеют интересы в Аргентине и хотят вытащить страну из сферы ОФН.

Он был неправ: Эйзенхауэр просто не мог допустить, чтобы сторонник фашизма оставался на задворках Америки. Неудивительно, что патриотическое население отвергло иностранное вмешательство в аргентинскую политику. От радикальных студентов колледжей, сжигающих американские флаги у посольства до офицеров-националистов, получающих загадочные телефонные звонки из Рима и Германии, заметно, что значительная часть населения не имеет ничего, кроме ненависти к Звездно-полосатым.

 ARGnews.1.desc:0 "Arturo Frondizi, the President of Argentina, has lost his Congressional majority after a catastrophically poor electoral showing by his Unión Cívica Radical. Amid the growing number of party dissidents, some veteran adversaries of the President have been quick to blame the loss on his purportedly poor administration of the Latin American nation, as well as his failed efforts to suppress internal Peronist influence - adherents of a populistic ideology endemic to Argentina.\n\nThe loss has exacerbated the mutual enmity of the Unión Cívica Radical's two wings, who now only tentatively share allegiance to their leader. The popular forecast of the Frondizi Presidency oscillates from resignation to military coup. Consensus, both outside and within the government, seems a distant notion.\n\n"

It is known that he is the most ruthless anti-Peronist in the entirety of the Argentine army; as such, most analysts concluded that he will go to great lengths in order to prevent a return of what he calls the "Peronist-Fascist menace".
